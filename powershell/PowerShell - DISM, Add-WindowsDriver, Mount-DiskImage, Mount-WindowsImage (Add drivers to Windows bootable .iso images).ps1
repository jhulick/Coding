# Download Updated Win10 installation media from URL:   https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10
#    > Select option "Create installation media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO file) for another pc" and output the .iso file to your desktop w/ name "Windows.iso"

#
# While that runs, go to the manufacturer's sites for the components which you'll be upgrading-to & need drivers for
#  > Grab drivers for:  GPU (graphics card), CPU (chipsets), RAID controllers (HBA), NICs (Network interface cards, wired & wireless), etc.
#   > These drivers will be 'burned' into the Windows .iso image
#    > Once you feel you have all/enough necessary drivers (formatted as .CAB files, which often have associated ini files), proceed with this script

# Mount the disk image, copy the working installation files off of it, then dismount the disk image

#   > Note: Not tested in an environment where every single drive letter is already taken/reserved by an existing disk/partition
#    > Note: Approach seems somewhat archaic - need to (ideally) update this methodology to work directly on/within a target .iso

### The soution for a Lenovo P520c workstation was two-part:
#
#
### Part 1/2: Set the following values within the BIOS/UEFI settings:
#
# SECURE BOOT = OFF
#
# CSM = ENABLED
#
# BOOT FROM PCI-E/PCI DEVICES --> SET TO BOOT FROM UEFI, FIRST
#
#
### Part 2/2
# > Injecting the necessary drivers into the Windows Install media's image (much easier than it sounds thanks to guide, below)
#  > Pull the RAID Controller drivers from your motherboard-manufacturer's website (if software RAID) or from your RAID-controller manufacturer's website (if hardware RAID)
#   > Install (unpack) all drivers into the directory "C:\Drivers" (create it if it doesn't already exist)
