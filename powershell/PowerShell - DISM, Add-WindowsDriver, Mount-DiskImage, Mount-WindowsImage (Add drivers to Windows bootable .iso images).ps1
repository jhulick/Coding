### Part 1/2: Set the following values within the BIOS/UEFI settings:
#
# SECURE BOOT = OFF
#
# CSM = ENABLED
#
# BOOT FROM PCI-E/PCI DEVICES --> SET TO BOOT FROM UEFI, FIRST
#
#
### Part 2/2
# > Injecting the necessary drivers into the Windows Install media's image (much easier than it sounds thanks to guide, below)
#  > Pull the RAID Controller drivers from your motherboard-manufacturer's website (if software RAID) or from your RAID-controller manufacturer's website (if hardware RAID)
#   > Install (unpack) all drivers into the directory "C:\Drivers" (create it if it doesn't already exist)
