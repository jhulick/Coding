# Using Gmail Filters ( https://mail.google.com/mail/#settings/filters )
#
#
#  To test a Gmail filter (e.g. perform a "dry-run" of what mail the filter will catch):
#    > Browse to Gmail ( https://mail.google.com/mail/#settings/filters )
#     > Paste query in top-middle bar with placeholder "Search mail" and press enter to dry-run the query
#
# 
#  To create a new Gmail filter (to automate handling of incoming email):
#    > Browse to Gmail ( https://mail.google.com/mail/#settings/filters )
#     > Login to desired Google account (click top-right icon > "Add another account" to change)
#      > Click the cog/gear icon ⚙️ (top-right)
#       > Click "See all settings" (top of cog-dropdown options)
#        > Click "Filters and Blocked Addresses" (top-middle, tab)
#         > Click "Create a new filter" (bottom-middle of filters table)
#          > Create filter as-intended (paste custom queries into the "Has the words" field)

#	Syntax
#
#		AND as a conditional
#

#	Use a single space so separate search-items (items CANNOT be wrapped in curly brackets - see OR conditional)
... ...

# Gmail example(s):
from:foo subject:bar
  |
  |--> In Layman's terms, require BOTH of the following:
        1 - Find emails with the word "foo" in either [ the email-address ] or [ email-account-alias (nickname) ]
        2 - Find emails with the word "bar" in the subject


# ------------------------------------------------------------
#	Syntax
#
#		OR as a conditional
#

# Option 1 - Use command OR (must be capitalized and have at least one space on each side) to separate search-items
... OR ...

# Option 2 - Wrap search-items with {curly bracets} and use space delimitation, ideally
{... ...}


# Gmail example(s):
from:foo OR subject:bar
{from:foo subject:bar}



# ------------------------------------------------------------
#	Syntax
#
#		NOT as a conditional
#

# Option 1: Use command NOT (must be capitalized and followed by at least one space) before search-item
NOT ...

# Option 2: Place a -minus sign, followed immediately by search-item (WITHOUT a space between the "-" and the search-item)
-...

# Gmail example(s):
NOT from:foo
-subject:bar



# ------------------------------------------------------------
#	Syntax
#
#		AROUND
#

# Option 1: Use command AROUND x between search-items (replace x with the maximum words between search-items)
... AROUND x ...

# Option 2: Wrap option 1 with double-quotes (") to match order of search-item (find first search-item, followed by x max words, followed by second search-item)
"... AROUND x ..."

# Gmail example(s):
foo AROUND 50 bar
"foo AROUND 50 bar"



# ------------------------------------------------------------
#	Syntax
#
#		Phrases
#

# Wrap phrases with double-quotes (") - note that negating to use the double-quotes will also match any items containing all search-items anywhere in them (see AND conditional)
"..."

# Gmail example(s):
"G Suite"



# ------------------------------------------------------------
#	Synax
#
#		Grouping conditionals
#

# Wrap search-items with (round bracets) and use space delimitation, ideally
(... ...)


# Gmail example(s):
(from:foo subject:bar) OR (from:bar subject:foo)
