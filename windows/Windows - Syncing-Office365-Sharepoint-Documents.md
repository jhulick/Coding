Syncing Shared files from Office365 to a local Windows instance

------------------------------------------------------------

Browse to the URL:  https://getacvideo55431.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/sharepoint.aspx

Login to your Microsoft Getac (getacvideo.com) user-account

Click the Star ⭐ Next to 'follow' the group you wish to sync (to follow it for simplified access, later)

After you've followed said group, click its name to browse to its SharePoint Page

Once in the group's SharePoint, select “Documents” on the left-menu (Note: “Sharepoint Documents” uses storage which is actually just Enterprsise-Office365-Group based OneDrive directories)

To sync the directory to your local PC, click “🔄 Sync” at the top of the "Document" page's table

Select “Open in OneDrive” on the popup (if shown – Chrome)

OneDrive should open on your local PC requesting a series of confirm/accepts for the local machine’s configuration - Walk through them and confirm as-needed (leave drive-location as default as general preference)

After you've finished the sync, you may access the directory quickly by opening Windows Explorer (to any directory) → On explorer's left menu, locate a Business-Building (🏢) icon just above "This PC" which should be shown as “🏢 Getac Video”.

  |→ Note: This storage is separate from your User directory/files synced to Office365's cloud storage.
