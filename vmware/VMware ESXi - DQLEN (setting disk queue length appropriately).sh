# To identify the storage adapter queue depth:
#   1. Run the esxtop command in the service console of the ESX host or the ESXi shell 
#       |--> !!! NOTE: in esxtop, pressing "h" will the help menu, including all available options - remember to press "h" if you get lost)
#   2. Press "d" to switch display to "d:disk adapter"
#   3. Press "f" to add a field, and select the "QSTATS = Queue Stats" field
#   4. The value listed in the "AQLEN" column is the queue depth of the storage adapter - This is the maximum number of ESX VMKernel active commands that the  [ ADAPTER DRIVER ]  is configured to support
#
#
# To identify the storage device queue depth:
#   1. Run the esxtop command in the service console of the ESX host or the ESXi shell
#   2. Press "u" to switch display to "u:disk device"
#   3. Press "f" to add a field, and select the "QSTATS = Queue Stats" field
#   4. The value listed in the "DQLEN" column is the queue depth of the storage device - This is the maximum number of ESX VMKernel active commands that the  [ DEVICE ]  is configured to support
#
# Notes:
#   The value listed under LQLEN is the LUN queue depth - This is the maximum number of ESX/ESXi VMkernel active commands supported by the LUN
#   The value listed under %USD is the percentage of queue depth (adapter, LUN, or world) used by ESX/ESXi VMkernel active commands
